time, but a moment later our mathematician-to-be raised his hand with the answer. \"It's 5050!\" Gauss had realized that if you list all the numbers from 1 to 100, you can always match the first and last numbers in the list and get a common answer:\n","\n","    1, 2, 3, ..., 98, 99, 100\n","    1 + 100 = 101\n","    2 + 99 = 101\n","    3 + 98 = 101\n","\n","Gauss realized there were exactly 50 pairs of numbers in the range 1 to 100, so he did a quick calculation: 50 * 101 = 5050.\n","\n","- Write a program that passes a list of numbers to a function.\n","    - The function should use a while loop to keep popping the first and last numbers from the list and calculate the sum of those two numbers.\n","    - The function should print out the current numbers that are being added, and print their partial sum.\n","    - The function should keep track of how many partial sums there are.\n","    - The function should then print out how many partial sums there were.\n","    - The function should perform Gauss' multiplication, and report the final answer.\n","- Prove that your function works, by passing in the range 1-100, and verifying that you get 5050.\n","    -
